Alexandre Nouar's projects - neuroscience and AI unique insights.

Source images and data were collected on OpenNeuro, https://docs.openneuro.org/index.html# This project is intended to make pattern matching of realtime brain iMRI and timelapse and events triggering reaction. We use 60 GDPR-friendly patients' data with data pre-processing and feature engineering so data can be used for deep learning.

It is intended to use C++ for core processes, all work on this matter is also ongoing.
